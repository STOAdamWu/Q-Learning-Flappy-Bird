# Q-Learning-Flappy-Bird
create an AI with Q-Learning 

In flappy_bird.py :
Set Human = True to enable Human playing.
The programme currently automatically load the 'birdking.json'.
You can disable it by delete the line.
I disabled the reward so I can watch its behaviour but you can uncomment related lines in MainLoop to enable it.
